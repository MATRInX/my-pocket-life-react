# MY-POCKET-LIFE with REACT

In this repository is my not final version of blog page original published on Blogger platform.
I have checked how to use Instagram or Blogger API to fetch data to my web app.
In this project I have used following technology:

+ React
+ Express server
+ React-Redux
+ React-Router
+ Jest/Enzyme (for tests)

## Instalation

If you want to check how it's work on your local machine just clone my repository:

```git
git clone git@github.com:MATRInX/my-pocket-life-react.git
```

## Usages

This app have (has) only one main objective - change typical Blogger page layout and show posts on page which I have create from the very beginning and I am able to fully maintain.

It was my first app after I finish React course. It was great opportunity for me to test and improve my skills in writing React app.

## Pros and cons

When I was writing this app my first big chellenge was to fetch information from Blogger and Instagram API.
I have spent a lot of time to check how this work, to learn how to configure this and then how to customize this.
For me big success was to handle this and when it has started to work my satisfaction was very big :)
With this app I have also first time used some third-party libraries in my app. This experience was also very important for me because gave me confidence that I am able to use any library which has of course minimal documentation:)

Weak point of this app is that I didn't finish it. When there were months on this blog without new posts my motivation began to decline. Also I didn't write as many test as possible and this is also weak point of this project. I have started to rewrite this app with Typescript but again without motivation that app will be alive I have decided to stop this project and try to learn new things like Socket.IO and GraphQL which I will use in my next apps.
